  This project concerns the generation of Lewis Carroll-like sentences using different architectures of neural networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformers). Additionally, we evaluate the results both quantitatively and qualitatively, employing various methods to improve these results. The methods used involve optimizing the hyper-parameters of the networks as well as modifying the input data (such as data augmentation and embedding techniques).

\section{Introduction}

The problem we aim to address is natural language generation, commonly used for text prediction/completion, content summarization, and chat-bots. A significant challenge in this field is evaluating the generated data, as there are numerous valid outputs and various qualitative and quantitative methods to assess a model and its outputs.

The main objective of this project is to compare different architectures and their effectiveness in generating coherent text. Additionally, we evaluate overall performance metrics, such as inference time and training time. We will optimize the results of the architectures through hyper-parameters tuning and employ data augmentation to achieve better generalization.

\section{Data}

\subsection{Original Data}

The data used in this project is the entire text of \textbf{Alice's Adventures in Wonderland} by Lewis Carroll, obtained from the Gutenberg Project. This book contains approximately \textbf{TODO} words. For our experiments, the text was divided into \textbf{TODO} training, validation, and test sets.

The preprocessing steps were minimal, focusing primarily on splitting the raw corpus into individual characters, as our initial experiments were conducted at the character level. We created a dictionary to map each character to a unique integer, facilitating the conversion of text into a numerical format suitable for model training. This approach allowed us to capture fine-grained details of the text generation process, though it required careful handling of character sequences to maintain coherence in the generated text.

\subsection{Data augmentation}

\textbf{TODO}

\section{Libraries used}

We base our work on the \textbf{PyTorch} llibrary to efficiently train our models on GPUs, saving time. For text processing, we used the \textbf{NLTK} library to retrieve and process the data, a crucial step in training models for text generation.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Training the networks}

\textbf{TO DELETE ??}

At first we wanted to start from a the most simple basis to be able to compare improvements with other architectures. That's why we implement a simple RNN with ADAM optimizer and a simple embedding layer. We wanted also to generate text from characters that's why we used as input characters and not words.

\subsection{Generating sequences} 

Several methods are available to generate sequences using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We experimented with three of them:

\textbf{Deterministic sampling} involves picking the word with the highest probability at each step. This approach produces the most predictable and coherent text, which is especially useful for tasks requiring high reliability. Additionally, it is straightforward to implement and understand. However, it often results in repetitive and monotonous text, as it tends to overuse common phrases and words, leading to less creative outputs.

\textbf{Temperature sampling} scales the probabilities with a temperature factor before sampling from the new distribution. A temperature value below 1 leads to more predictable generations, while a value above 1 results in less predictable, more diverse, but potentially less grammatically correct outputs. This method allows fine-tuning of the randomness in text generation, enabling a balance between coherence and diversity. Its versatility makes it suitable for different types of content, from highly structured to more creative texts. On the downside, finding the optimal temperature can be challenging and may require extensive experimentation. Additionally, high temperatures can lead to nonsensical or grammatically incorrect sentences.

\textbf{Nucleus sampling} (also known as top-p sampling) defines a threshold \(p\) and only keeps the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is above this threshold. Words are then sampled from this truncated distribution. This method strikes a balance between determinism and randomness, often resulting in coherent yet diverse text. By eliminating unlikely and potentially irrelevant words, it improves the overall quality of the text. However, it is more complex to implement compared to deterministic sampling, and the choice of threshold \(p\) can significantly impact the output, requiring careful fine-tuning.

Each method has its own advantages and trade-offs, making them suitable for different types of text generation tasks. Deterministic sampling is ideal for scenarios requiring high reliability and consistency, temperature sampling offers flexibility in creativity, and nucleus sampling provides a good balance between the two.


\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

To evaluate the performance of our text generation models, we used several metrics:

\textbf{Loss:} We primarily monitored cross-entropy loss during training, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual word distributions. Lower loss indicates better model predictions.

\textbf{Type-Token Ratio (TTR):} This metric measures lexical diversity by calculating the ratio of unique words (types) to total words (tokens) in the generated text. A higher TTR indicates more diverse vocabulary.

\textbf{Percentage of Correctly Spelled Words:} This metric evaluates the spelling accuracy of the generated text by comparing each word to a standard dictionary, providing a percentage of correctly spelled words.

\textbf{Perplexity:} Perplexity assesses how well the model predicts a word sequence, with lower values indicating better performance. It is the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood of the predicted word sequence.

\textbf{BLEU Score:} The BLEU score evaluates the quality of generated text by comparing it to reference texts, measuring the precision of matching n-grams. Higher BLEU scores indicate better alignment with human-written text.

Using these metrics, we ensured a comprehensive evaluation of both the training process and the quality of the generated text.


\textbf{TODO}

\section{Experiments}

In our experiments, we systematically evaluated various aspects of our text generation models. The primary focus was on comparing different architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques to optimize performance. The experiments were structured as follows:

\subsection{Model Architecture Comparison}

We began by comparing the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Both architectures were tested with one and two layers to understand the impact of model depth on text generation quality. The comparison aimed to determine whether the additional complexity of LSTMs provided significant improvements over standard RNNs and how model depth influenced performance.

\subsection{Hidden Nodes Analysis}

Next, we conducted a study on the impact of the number of hidden nodes in the network. Various configurations were tested to identify the optimal size of the hidden layer. This analysis was crucial in balancing the trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency.

\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}

We then explored how different learning rates and batch sizes affected the learning process. By systematically varying these hyperparameters, we aimed to find the optimal settings that would lead to faster convergence and better overall performance. The learning rate controls the step size during gradient descent, while the batch size determines the number of samples processed before updating the model parameters.

\subsection{Regularization Techniques}

To address overfitting, we experimented with several regularization techniques. Dropout was applied to randomly set a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training, which helps prevent the network from becoming too specialized to the training data. Additionally, layer normalization was implemented to normalize the inputs of each layer, stabilizing the learning process and improving model generalization.

\subsection{Data Augmentation}

Finally, we explored data augmentation methods to increase the diversity of our training data. This involved generating additional training samples by applying various transformations to the original data, which aimed to improve the model's robustness and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Each of these experiments provided valuable insights into the factors influencing the performance of our text generation models. The results guided us in selecting the best model configuration and training strategies for optimal text generation.




\textbf{TODO}

\section{Results}

The firsts model were really not interesting and we obtain almost random generation (however, some words were understandable even though that was a simplle RNN based on char representation) like that:

\section{Submission of papers to NeurIPS 2023}

Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully. \textbf{Important:} This year the checklist will be submitted separately from the main paper in OpenReview, please review it well ahead of the submission deadline: \url{https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist}.


\subsection{Style}


Papers to be submitted to NeurIPS 2023 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to {\bf nine} pages long,
including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only acknowledgments and
references} are allowed. Papers that exceed the page limit will not be
reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the conference.


The margins in 2023 are the same as those in previous years.


Authors are required to use the NeurIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files
and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
rejection.


\subsection{Retrieval of style files}


The style files for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on
the website at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://www.neurips.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+neurips_2023.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
various formatting requirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.


The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2023 is \verb+neurips_2023.sty+,
rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{} 2.09,
  Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}


The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
\verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.


\paragraph{Preprint option}
If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a
nonanonymized version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit, as long as you do not say which conference it was submitted to. Please \textbf{do
  not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
papers accepted to NeurIPS. 


At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.


The file \verb+neurips_2023.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
the paper with your own.


The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.


\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}


The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
indentation.


The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
top of the page.


For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
side.


Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}


All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
flush left, and bold.


First-level headings should be in 12-point type.


\subsection{Headings: second level}


Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.


\subsubsection{Headings: third level}


Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.


\paragraph{Paragraphs}


There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
of space.


\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}


These instructions apply to everyone.


\subsection{Citations within the text}


The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
used consistently.


The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}


If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
following before loading the \verb+neurips_2023+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}


If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2023}
\end{verbatim}


As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous'' and include a copy of the anonymized paper in the supplementary material.


\subsection{Footnotes}


Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).


Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}


\subsection{Figures}


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}


All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
color.


\subsection{Tables}


All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.


Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.


Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.


\begin{table}
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Math}
Note that display math in bare TeX commands will not create correct line numbers for submission. Please use LaTeX (or AMSTeX) commands for unnumbered display math. (You really shouldn't be using \$\$ anyway; see \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to} and \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/40492/what-are-the-differences-between-align-equation-and-displaymath} for more information.)

\subsection{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.


\section{Preparing PDF files}


Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
example, ``A4.''


Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
achieve this.


\begin{itemize}


\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
  menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
  also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
  available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
  "solid" shapes instead.


\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
  the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


\end{itemize}


If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
you to fix it.


\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
necessary.


\begin{ack}
Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure}.


Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to autmoatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
\end{ack}



\section{Supplementary Material}

Authors may wish to optionally include extra information (complete proofs, additional experiments and plots) in the appendix. All such materials should be part of the supplemental material (submitted separately) and should NOT be included in the main submission.


\section*{References}


References follow the acknowledgments in the camera-ready paper. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
when listing the references.
Note that the Reference section does not count towards the page limit.
